## Overview

The Doctor Appointment Booking API is designed to streamline the process of scheduling appointments between patients and doctors. The system supports:

Doctor Registration: A portal for doctors to register and provide details such as specialty and experience.
Appointment Booking: Patients can book appointments with doctors based on availability, subject to a 15-day window.
Payment Processing: Integrated payment functionality for confirming appointments.
Cancellation & Rescheduling: Patients can cancel (if more than 3 days remain) or reschedule their appointments. Doctors can also cancel or reschedule appointments and notify affected patients.
Waitlist Notifications: If a doctorâ€™s appointment slots are full, patients can be placed on a waitlist and will be notified if a slot becomes available.
Appointment Limit: Each doctor is limited to 30 appointments.

## Features

## Doctor Registration Portal
    Doctors register and provide details including specialty, experience, and contact information.

## Patient Appointment Booking
    Patients book appointments within a 15-day window.
    The system ensures that each doctor can only accept up to 30 appointments.

## Payment Integration
    Payment processing is integrated using a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal).

## Cancellation & Rescheduling
    Patients can cancel appointments if there are more than 3 days remaining before the scheduled time.
    Doctors can cancel or reschedule appointments and notify patients accordingly.

## Waitlist & Notifications
    If a booking is not possible due to slot limitations, patients can join a waitlist.
    In case of cancellation, waitlisted patients are notified about available appointment slots.

## Technology Stack

    Backend: Python, Django, Django REST Framework
    Database: PostgreSQL
    Asynchronous Tasks: Celery with Redis
    Payment Integration: PayPal SDK
    Version Control: Git (hosted on GitHub)

## Project Architecture

## Modular Code Structure:
The project is divided into modular Django apps (e.g., accounts, appointments, payments) to enhance maintainability and testability.

## Custom User & Role-Based Profiles:
A custom user model (CustomUser) differentiates between doctors and patients, with role-specific data stored in dedicated profile models.

## RESTful API Endpoints:
All functionalities are exposed as REST API endpoints, which can be consumed by any client (e.g., Postman, mobile apps).

## Asynchronous Processing:
Celery and Redis are used for background tasks like sending email notifications.

## Secure and Testable:
The code is designed to be safe, portable, and easily testable across environments.

## Installation & Setup
## Prerequisites

    Python 3.10+
    Redis (for Celery)
    A relational database (SQLite is used by default; configure PostgreSQL if needed)
    Git

## Backend Setup

## Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Towet-Tum/Doctor-Visit-App.git

## Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file (or configure environment variables) with values such as:

    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
    DEBUG=True
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3  # Or your MySQL configuration
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your-paypal-client-id
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-paypal-client-secret
    PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox  # Change to "live" in production
    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
    EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-email-provider.com
    EMAIL_PORT=587
    EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@example.com
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-email-password
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

## Apply Migrations:

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

## Create a Superuser:

    python manage.py createsuperuser

## Run the Development Server:

    python manage.py runserver

## Start Celery Worker (in a separate terminal):

    celery -A your_project_name worker --loglevel=info
